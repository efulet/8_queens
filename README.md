# Eight Queens problem

Using a regular chess board, the challenge is to place eight queens on the board 
such that no queen is attacking any of the others. (For those not familiar with 
chess pieces, the queen is able to attack any square on the same row, any square 
on the same column, and also any square on either of the diagonals).

This proof of concept is using popular search algorithms:
  * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  * Depth-First Search (DFS)
  * Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

## Usage

```bash
$> python 8_queens/main.py -h
usage: main.py [--show]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -s, --show  show the solutions as a board representation
```
